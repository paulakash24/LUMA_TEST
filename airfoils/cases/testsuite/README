*** Directory explanations ***
base	-> contains the reference data to be compared against
defs	-> contains the definitions files for each case
input	-> contains the input files needed for specific cases
notes	-> contains notes and information about the test suite
results	-> directory where output from test suite is written (this gets deleted and re-created each time the test suite is run)
scripts	-> contains the script to run the test suits (test suite should be run from this directory)


*** How to run test suite ***
1) Navigate to scripts directory
2) Run runTestSuite.sh
3) Check master log file to see overview of results
4) Check each case directory within the results directory to check a specific case
5) The master log is written to the main testsuite directory, compile logs are written as well as a diff log (if required) in each case directory


*** Options ***
clean | --clean | -c -> will just delete the results directory (should be done before pushing so as to reduce data stored on the repo)
